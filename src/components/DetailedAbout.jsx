        <p>Hi! I'm Andrew Earl and programming has been my thing since childhood. My love and passion with computer games made me get interested in programming
            by creating my own games. My first programming experience happened in Roblox Studio, it was the best decision I ever made as Roblox Studio's programming
            language is Lua. Now Lua thought me all basic fundamentals in programming which I'm able to use to learn other programming languages much easier. Back when I was a kid
            I never really considered to make a career out of programming, I was just coding for fun and making my favorite Anime series into video games.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I get to college, my programming activities were suppressed due to how busy I am in academics. But still I was able to try out other Game Engines such as Unity and Godot,
            which both uses C# as their programming language. The program I enrolled in college included a Programming course as well which introduced me to C and C++. Unfortunately, the program
            I enrolled with is Electrical Engineering Technology due to my parents decision. Computer Science or Information Technology was my first pick when I was about to get in to college, but
            I still went with my parents decision on what program they like me to enroll. Basically, they want me to become an Engineer.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Now I'm a career shifter, as I've realized after graduating college and working in BPO industry for 2 years that I can do more if I start using my programming skills as a career.
            This is when I found out about KodeGo and enrolled myself in the bootcamp. This bootcamp thought me alot and made me a Full Stack Web Developer. The first 3 projects you'll
            be seeing in my portfolio are the projects I made inside the bootcamp.
        </p>
        <p>
            As long as I'm still capable of coding, I will keep creating new projects and learn more programming languages.
